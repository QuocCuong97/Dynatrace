(**Passing percent**: `93.2%`)
### **Question 1)**
- Why is it a best practice to define extra metadata, and not tags, on a host system?
    - [ ] It isn't a best practice. Tags are easy to define and change on a host on the fly and they can pass dynamic data to Dynatrace.
    - [ ] Host tags can only be assigned automatically via the metadata delivered to Dynatrace.
    - [ ] Tags defined on the host can only be assigned manually, making them difficult to manage. Metadata is contained in a config file on the host, which is easier to define.

    - [ ] The traffic overhead generated by network monitoring is negligible and varies based on the analyzed traffic volume, so there is no need to monitor the effect Dynatrace has on network performance.
    - [x] Dynatrace monitors the overhead generated by network monitoring, and if it exceeds 5% of available CPU, network monitoring is paused.
    - [ ] Dynatrace monitors the overhead generated by network monitoring and if it exceeds 2% of available CPU, network monitoring is paused.
